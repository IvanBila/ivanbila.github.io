If we use GraphQL it's not uncommon that the schema gets updated, furthermore it's sometimes expected that the updates
brings new features to the schema, these can be breaking, or non-breaking, but nevertheless change how a query is executed.

[graphql-schema-diff](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-schema-diff) allows us to view schema diffs in a way that's easy to
digest and actionable, without needing to go through the changelog or viewing large diffs, along with graphql-schema-diff, we'll
use the `get-graphql-schema` package to get the schema from a GraphQL server.

We can run `npx get-graphql-schema <url>/graphql > schema.graphql` to get the schema in a given domain, and then compare the old
schema to the new one using:

```sh
npx graphql-schema-diff schema.graphql schema-v1.graphql
```

We can also specify other options which can allow us to see the full diffs in an `html` file on the browser using the
`--create-html-output` option.

The command above should give you a summary of the diffs in the schema, and it groups them by `dangerous` and `breaking changes`,
you can see below an example of how the output looks like(Magento 2.3 to 2.4 schema changes):

```
