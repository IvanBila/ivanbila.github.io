According to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) the anchor tag,
creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, locations in the same page, or anything else a URL can address.

I often joke about the anchor `a` tag being overpowered and
in my opinion, one of the most important tags on the HTML spec,
it can do anything from linking pages, running JavaScript
and even making phone calls.

The most common use of the `a` tag is to open a link, and here's how we can use it
to open a link:

Open a simple link, using the same tab:

```html
<a href="https://google.com">Website</a>
```

With the `target` attribute we can specify where the link should be displayed, a browsing context which
can be an iframe, a tab, or a window).

The `target` possible values start with an underscore, it's not clear as to why, but I think it's to avoid conflict,
as [outlined in this stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/22290033/6670258).The default value is `_self`
which means the link will be opened in the same tab or current browsing context, `_blank` will usually open a new
tab unless the browser configuration specifies a different behavior, and then there's `_parent` and top `_top`
which check the parent browsing context or fallback to `_self` and the topmost browsing context.

Here are some examples:

```html
<a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">Website</a>
```

```html
<a href="https://google.com" target="_self">Website</a>
```

Note that links to cross-origins destinations are unsafe and can create a performance issues when used with
the `target="_blank"` attribute, this is because the [other page may run on the same process](https://web.dev/external-anchors-use-rel-noopener/) as your page.

If the other page is running heavy JavaScript tasks, your page's performance may suffer, or in the second case where the
other page can access the `window.opener.location` and redirect the user to another page, which could be a security risk,
since the other origin might create a phishing page similar to your website.

If you're using a modern browser(>= [Chromium 88](https://chromestatus.com/feature/6140064063029248)) this should not
be an issue since the `rel="noopener"` attribute is implicitly added, but if you're sure, you're using an older browser,
you should add it manually.

One common use for the `a` tag is to allow users to contact you via email, often found on contact page, however you can also prompt a phone call and
open a sms app to send a message, here are some examples:

Opens an email client which `ivan@example.com` as the receiver.

```html
<a href="mailto:ivan@example.com">Send Email</a>
```

Open the default dialer to make a phone call:

```html
<a href="tel:+123456789">call</a>
```

Opens the default messenger to send sms:

```html
<a href="sms:+123456789">Send SMS</a>
```

Send an SMS and specify the body:

```html
<a href="sms:+258841234567?&body=hello world">Send Hello world SMS</a>
```

Execute JavaScript code:

Browsers have a built-in mechanism to execute JavaScript code typed in the address bar,
this is called `javascript:` and it's used to execute code in the context of the page.
While not something that should be used in production, it's a very useful feature to explore
and test, and possibly mitigate for self XSS.
The JavaScript code that can be executed is only limited by the address bar limit(which should be around [2,000 characters](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/417142/what-is-the-maximum-length-of-a-url-in-different-browsers)),
however, this can be bypassed by using the address bar itself to load an external script.

Here's an example where we use the address bar to load external an external JavaScript file:

```html
<a
  href='javascript:var evilScript = document.body.appendChild(document.createElement("script")); evilScript.type = "text/javascript"; evilScript.src = "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/vue/2.6.10/vue.esm.js"'
  >Click me</a
>
```

Rename a file when downloaded

```html
<a href="my_painting.png" download="my_painting.png">Download my painting</a>
```

Ping an origin:

```html
<a ping="http://www.example.com/pingback/" href="http://www.example.com/">Ping me</a>
```

Navigate to a given fragment on the website:

```html
<a href="#header">Fragment</a>
```

As we can see the `a` tag is quite powerful, [this site](https://anchors.vercel.app/) outlines a lot of the
possible uses of the `a` tag.

I hope you learned something new or got a deeper understanding of the `a` tag, and if you did, share it with the community so they too
can learn about this topic.
