First off, I'd like to mention that I'm not a security expert, I like to believe I'm a programmer.

NOTICE: Some steps will be omitted or under specified since I don't want people to use this article for
malicious intents.

The [usa.gov](https://www.usa.gov/identity-theft) outlines that: Identity theft happens when someone
steals your personal information to commit fraud.

I often see a handful of Facebook posts or people in general sharing about lost items, dogs and even
people while this may seem benign it exposes people's data and sensitive information for everyone to
see in a way that does more damage than helps, therefore here I'll play a role of a possible
thread-actor looking to loot or exploit the data that's shared by users online, most specifically Facebook.

We'll scrape Mozambican users documents(ID, Passport, Driver's License, Car Documents, Bank Debit
or Credit card, etc.) which contain sensitive data and attempt to make online payments with the
debit or credit card then proceed to categorize and exploit.

The first phase of the "hack" is to jump on Facebook and find the search terms that will allow
us to find these documents, but these search terms will be slightly limited, and we'd have to
find one set of documents at the time, some "clever" users went ahead and created
groups, named: Achados e Perdidos, Documentos Perdidos and so forth, in a mixture of groups,
pages and public posts you can find a plethora of sensitive documents or information that
shouldn't be available online, here are some of the search terms we can use:

- BI perdido
- Carta de Condução perdida
- Documentos achados
- Documentos Perdidos

And we can also use Facebook's own suggestion system to find the search terms that will allow us to find these documents,
here's a screenshot of how the suggestions look like:

Additionally, we can set the search to only show posts from a given location or use any other filters
to fine tune it.

Another useful resource as mentioned above is groups there people dump sensitive documents almost
weekly, and the best part is that if you search for Achados e perdidos for example, Facebook will
either suggest other groups or show it in the "explore your interest" section, see screenshots below:

And Facebook itself allows you to check related groups:

In some posts we'll find a full data dump containing almost all documents as seen in the screenshot below,
notice that I've blurred the user's name. Below we'll find user's ID, debit card, Vaccination card, Car
registry documents, and driving license:

By downloading an image at a time or a set of images you can build up a large data set of people's documents,
here's a small set I was able to create in a short period of time:
<center>![Data set](/static/images/identity-theft-part-i/data-set.jpg)</center>
But downloading every document manually and then proceeding to sort them would be rather cumbersome or
tiring, that's why you can use a tool such as [Puppeteer](https://puppeteer.dev/) to automate the process
of search and downloading the images, and you can even go to the extra mile and use the free [Firebase
ML](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ml-kit/quickstart) to train a model that will identify documents
or credit/debit cards and then use it to automatically categorize the images.

And lastly is to create some mechanism to attempt to bill the credit or debit cards that allow internet purchases, we can do this by
training yet another model for identifying credit or debit cards numbers and store them in a table which we can then in turn use GitHub
actions to run a script that attempts to bill them, once a week.

You might wonder whether if it's possible to make an online purchase using only the credit card number since this is usually the only
visible part in the screenshots, yes it is possible the other details are mostly for fraud prevention or getting a discount on the
payment gateway, [You can learn more here](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/21172/278427).

Now that we've used limited tools and techniques to perform identity theft, you might be wondering what's next? In the upcoming article
I'll show a different mechanism which does not use OSINT to perform the hack, my goal with these set of articles is to help people understand
the dangers of sharing documents online in the hopes getting the owner to find it, more often than not someone which not well intended might
find it first and use it to commit fraud.

I hope that someone in the Facebook team finds this article and gives the proper fix, warning the users attempting to
post documents online, or even better to blur the document fields or suggest blurring use ML would help greatly both the users
who are in the platform and the one that are not.
